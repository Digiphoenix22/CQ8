Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because the recursive function processes each character exactly once.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, where no characters are the same, the function will recurse n times, leading to n stack frames.
